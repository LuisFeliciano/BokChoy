# BokChoy @BokChoyDog

### Inforation:
* Developed by Luis Feliciano
* For CPS 470 Computer Networks
* Follow Bok Choy at @BokChoyDog

### Purpose:
The purpose of this project was to work with the Twitter API to develop an automated bot account for my dog Bok Choy. This application tweets for my dog each day at 8:00 AM. A tweet from Bok Choy usually contains a mix of [woof, bark, bork] with a stunning and beatiful picture of Bok Choy.

This project was part of Assignment 2 for CPS 470 Computer Networks in which I was tasked to have creative application for the Twitter API.

### Build and Deployment
This bot was developed using Python and deployed in Python 3.6.9. Some of the critical libraries used for this was tweepy which connects to the Twitter API.

For deployment I used Heroku which allows simple deployment of my python script which tweets for Bok Choy. It is also possible to run locally with the simple command: python bokchoybot.py

### Demo & Functionality

Here is a sample of how the Bok Choy Twitter Account looks like:

Tweets by Bok Choy are a combination of [woof, bark, bork] and they message is always randomly generated. Each tweet is sent out at 8:00 AM and contains an adorable image of Bok Choy with all her happiness. Sample tweet below:
